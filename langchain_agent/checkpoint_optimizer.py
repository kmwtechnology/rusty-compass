"""
Custom checkpoint serialization for selective state persistence.

Excludes large fields from checkpoint storage while preserving essential state
for conversation recovery. This reduces checkpoint size and improves write performance.

Usage:
    from checkpoint_optimizer import SelectiveJsonPlusSerializer
    checkpointer = PostgresSaver(pool, serde=SelectiveJsonPlusSerializer())
